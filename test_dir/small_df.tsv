COP1	CAUSES	WARM TEMPERATURE SIGNALS	28418582	COP1	GM	1	Plants adjust their architecture to optimize growth and reproductive success under changing climates. Hypocotyl elongation is a pivotal morphogenic trait that is profoundly influenced by light and temperature conditions. While hypocotyl photomorphogenesis has been well characterized at the molecular level, molecular mechanisms underlying hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) conveys warm temperature signals to hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis. To investigate the roles of COP1 and its target ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) during hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis, we employed Arabidopsis mutants that are defective in their genes. Transgenic plants overexpressing the genes were also produced. We examined hypocotyl growth and thermoresponsive turnover rate of HY5 protein at warm temperatures under both light and dark conditions. Elevated temperatures trigger the nuclear import of COP1, thereby alleviating the suppression of hypocotyl growth by HY5. While the thermal induction of hypocotyl growth is circadian-gated, the degradation of HY5 by COP1 is uncoupled from light responses and timing information. We propose that thermal activation of COP1 enables coincidence between warm temperature signaling and circadian rhythms, which allows plants to gate hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis at the most profitable time at warm temperatures.	1	1	0	1
PHYB	AFFECTS	GERMINATION ACROSS A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES	17504457	PHYB	GM	1	Germination timing is a fundamental life-history trait, as seedling establishment predicates realized fitness in the wild. Light and temperature are two important cues by which seeds sense the proper season of germination. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we provide evidence that phytochrome-mediated germination pathways simultaneously respond to light and temperature cues in ways that affect germination. Phytochrome mutant seeds were sown on agar plates and allowed to germinate in lit, growth chambers across a range of temperatures (7 degrees C to 28 degrees C). phyA had an important role in promoting germination at warmer temperatures, phyE was important to germination at colder temperatures and phyB was important to germination across a range of temperatures. Different phytochromes were required for germination at different temperatures, indicating a restriction or even a potential specialization of individual phytochrome activity as a function of temperature. This temperature-dependent activity of particular phytochromes reveals a potentially novel role for phytochrome pathways in regulating the seasonal timing of germination.	1	1	0	0
